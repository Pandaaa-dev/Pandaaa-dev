# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Omi!

Iâ€™m a passionate student from **North South University, Bangladesh**, on a journey from self-taught coder to tech explorer. Always eager to dive into new fields and expand my horizons, Iâ€™m here to learn, build, and collaborate!

## ðŸš€ Skills & Technologies

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what Iâ€™m currently working with:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** JavaScript, React, Vue.js, Node.js, Express.js
- **Discord Development:** Discord.js
- **Mobile Development:** React Native (currently learning! technically not mobile, but hey, still counts >.<)
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning

Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of **React Native** and looking forward to exploring more exciting technologies in the near future. Other than that, trying to get the basics about **Web-Scraping** down, and get a little bit of leetcoding done. A lot of work to be done!
